This project is a front-end React application built with React that allows users to explore movies in a fun and intuitive way. The app fetches popular movies from The Movie Database API and displays them in a visually appealing grid layout. Users can search for movies by title using a smart search feature.

One of the key features of the project is the ability to mark movies as favorites. By clicking the favorite button, users can add movies to their favorites, and these selections are saved using React Context and persisted in localStorage so they are retained across sessions. A dedicated favorites page allows users to review all the movies they've marked as favorites.

The project emphasizes responsiveness and smooth user interaction, featuring clean UI transitions and a modern design that looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.

Overall, this project not only provides a robust movie browsing experience but also introduces key front-end development practices such as API integration, state management with Context, and responsive design using CSS.
